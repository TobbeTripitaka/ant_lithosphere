---

This repository contains code related to a manuscript (Accepted for publication in Frontiers in Earth Science-Solid Earth Geophysics). 

The Jupyter Notebook contains urls to relevant code and datasets used. 

The netCDF file is a low resolution version of the model generated in the paper.

- A higher resolution constructed model can be downloaded from [here](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/gwthBd9wHI6c5sm) (2GB)
- A Virtual Machine with agrid installed can be downloaded from [here](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/gwthBd9wHI6c5sm) (4GB) 
- agrid is available from [here](https://github.com/TobbeTripitaka/agrid)

The virtual machine comes with a minimal Python installation, including agrid and a short test notebook.
